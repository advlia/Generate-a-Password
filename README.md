# Random-Password-Generator


##Purpose
This website was created to assist employees in generating a random strong and secure password.
I modified Javascript code to work efficiently and act as a fully responsive webpage, so it will adjust to all screen sizes. HTML and CSS were also updated. My motivation was to understand JS code better. I practiced using and defining funtions and arrays. I also added an event listener and loop funtion.

##Usage
After the user clicks the generate password button, they will be asked for their password length preference
(must be 1 to 128 characters). If input number is invalid an error will display and exit.
It will then ask if they want uppercase, lowercase, or special characters. A random password will then be generated.
