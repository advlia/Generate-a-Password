# Random-Password-Generator

This website was created to assist employees in generating a random strong and secure password.
I modified Javascript code to work efficiently and act as a fully responsive webpage, so it will adjust to all screen sizes. HTML and CSS were also updated. My motivation was to understand JS code better and how to add event listeners, 

After user clicks generate password, they will be asked for their password length preference
(must be 1 to 128 characters), if input number is invalid an error will display and exit.
It will then ask if they want uppercase, lowercase, or special characters. A random password will then be generated
